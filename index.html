    <h3>Hobbies, areas of interest</h3>
    <p>(age 6-19); Piano--I was greatly influence first by my mother (who herself descended from several female pianists of a modest Lutheran-Midwestern tradition), and then learned by weekly lessons from Audrey Owen. Favorite composers include Rachmaninoff, Chopin, and Beethoven. At the peak of a depression during my later teenage years, the Piano was a great emotional outlet for me, and it was at this time that my abilities peaked. I won the Clinton Symphony Young Artist competition at age 16 which entitled me to perform a concerto accompanied by the local symphony (Saint-Saëns No.2 Op.22). For several years I also worked as a churg organist and as a freelance piano-player for weddings/restaurants/events.
    <br>(age 9-16); Cello--This always fell second to the Piano, but I am forevere grateful for the patient, generous, meticulous instruction I received from Greg and Julie Marston in our public high school's motley music program.
    <br>(age 10-12); Dissembling and mechanically modifying toy Nerf guns.
    <br>(age 11-14); Competitive Rubik's cube speed-solving.
    <br>(age 14- ); Reading--list of books I have read--for some of these I have written reviews or other thoughts.
    <br>(age 16-20); Writing poetry and short fiction--selected works--much of this endeavor was individual, but also much was as a member of a literary society I founded (The Fishermen, members also including John Steger, Vamsi Marla, Dan Fullick, and Nick Beckwith).
    <br>(age 17- ); Calisthenics.
    <br>(age 21- ); Cooking--of note for an initial 5 years I followed a strictly vegan diet, which by virtue of a restriction forced me to paradoxically expand my appreciation for many vegetables and other food-items I had previously overlooked--I now follow a less constrained diet.
    <br>(age 22-25); Cycling.
    <br>(age 23- ); Walking--it was not until my frontal lobe had mostly finished developing that I was able to find value in the simple act of outdoor ambulation (rigorous/adventurous hiking is a separate matter). This was initially shown to me by my father (who, by the way, walks with his arms folded behind his back).
    <br>(age 25- ); Trains and Transit--I have a particular affinity for this form of public transit, which I enjoy both as a passenger, and as an amateur student of its mechanics and history. I am currently endevaoring to visit all 472 subway stations in New York. I also have an interest in airplanes and commercial air travel.
